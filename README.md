# Cozen O'Connor Claims Recovery Trend Dashboard

## Introduction
I have worked at Cozen O'Connor as an Information Systems intern, where I have built and optimized BI reports for the Subrogation department. One of the reports I optimized tracks the statute of limitations on active claims, displaying claims that were approaching the relevant statute. After converting the report from a PDF to Excel file, the report was able to run weekly faster with lesser manual work of the BI team. The dataset I used for this project is a sample of the report. Information, such as analyst names, have been altered to keep private of the company's information.
