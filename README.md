# Cozen O'Connor Claims Recovery Trend Dashboard

## Introduction
I have worked at Cozen O'Connor as an Information Systems intern, where I have built and optimized BI reports for the Subrogation department. One of the reports I optimized tracks the statute of limitations on active claims, displaying claims that were approaching the relevant statute. After converting the report from a PDF to Excel file, the report was able to run weekly faster with lesser manual work of the BI team. The dataset I used for this project is a sample of the report. Information, such as analyst names, have been altered to keep private of the company's information.

## Questions to Ask
- What variables correlate with paid claim amount?
- Which date variable is the most significant to determine the paid claim amount?
- At what time period the paid claim amounts are at its peak?
- What recovery stages associate with low and high paid claim amount?
- Do the add and SOL projected dates affect the paid claim amount?

## Tools Used
- Python for data exploration, analysis, and visualization
- Power BI for displaying KPIs, graphs, and filters

## Dataset

  The dataset consists of 238 claims. The columns are:
- Unique Identifier: Code that distinguishes a claim from others.
- Analyst: Name of the analyst who is handling or is responsible for the case.
- Incident Date: The date on which the incident occurred or was initially reported.
- SOL PD (Statute of Limitations Projected Date): Estimated date for when a task, project, or event will be completed.
- Litigation Date Type: Category of dates associated with the litigation process.
- Paid Claim: Amount that has been paid out for a claim.
- Add Date: The date when this case or incident was added to the tracking system.
- Recovery Stage: The current stage of the recovery or resolution process for this case. The demand has been made and is under review by the opposing party or their insurance carrier.
