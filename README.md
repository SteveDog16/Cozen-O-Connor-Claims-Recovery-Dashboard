# Cozen O'Connor Claims Recovery Trend Dashboard

## Introduction
I have worked at Cozen O'Connor as an Information Systems intern, where I have built and optimized BI reports for the Subrogation department. One of the reports I optimized tracks the statute of limitations on active claims, displaying claims that were approaching the relevant statute. After converting the report from a PDF to Excel file, the report was able to run weekly faster with lesser manual work of the BI team. The dataset I used for this project is a sample of the report. Information, such as analyst names, have been altered to keep private of the company's information.

## Questions to Ask
- What variables correlate with paid claim amount?
- Which date variable is the most significant to determine the paid claim amount?
- At what time period the paid claim amounts are at its peak?
- What recovery stages associate with low and high paid claim amount?
- Do the add and SOL projected dates affect the paid claim amount?

  # Tools Used
  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Power BI

  # Dataset

  The dataset consists of 238 claims. The columns are:
  - Unique Identifier:
  - Analyst
  - Incident Date
  - SOL PD
  - Litigation Date Type
  - Paid Claim
  - Add Date
  - Recovery Stage
